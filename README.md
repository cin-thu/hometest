# Cinnamon AI Lab Hometest

### Description
- This is a small hometest for online interview at Cinnamon AI Lab. This is for **Frontend development** assessment
- It should take no more than 3 days for you to complete the test. Don't feel so stressed about this, just show us the best you can do. Even if you can't finish it, submit what you can. This will help us understand your skills and the way you tackle a feature requirement
- You must use **React** for this assignment. You can also use other libraries like Lodash, Redux or whatever you like to help with your development

### Workflow
- You can fork this repo and start coding
- When you finish your work, push your code to the forked repo and notify us via email

### Task
- You will implement a simple *User Management page* base on the given design (please check out the zip file)
- This page will display users from Github. You can use Github api to fetch live data (please refer to their doc)
- The search input will also fetch live data from Github
- Each row in the table will contain:
  - ID
  - Github username
  - Github link
  - Actions: Delete and download (just for show, no actions needed)
- Each row can be selected, and you can select multiple rows. Please refer to design for more information
- The table can be sorted by ID and username (alphabetically). Please note that Github api doesn't support this, so you must do this on client side
